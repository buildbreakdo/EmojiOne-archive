## History
> EmojiTwo is a fork of the last fully free EmojiOne™ 2.x version.
> The non-free EmojiOne 3.0 assets have been completely deleted.
> The EmojiOne project made changes to 2.2.7’s licensing. Previously EmojiOne did not require attribution for non-commercial 
> and personal use 
> (for proof see [this snapshot of their website](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170327003706/http://emojione.com/licensing/#attribution)). 
> Considering that the EmojiOne project ony changed the ReadMe file in that branch to mandate attribution in any case, 
> EmojiTwo forked a state before those changes for greater flexibility.
> Whether or not EmojiTwo will see continued development, is not clear. At the very least it serves as backup. Hopefully Free > Software organsizations that adopted EmojiOne 2.x, such as Mozilla and KDE, will continue development of a fully free emoji > set in some form.
